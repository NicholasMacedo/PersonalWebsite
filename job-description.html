          <p>As a co-op as ADknown, I was able to gain a lot of experience pertaining to full stack web development. Throughout my eight-month co-op placement at ADknown I was able to work on multiple different projects with the guidance and mentorship of Benjin Yap.</p>
          <p>The first couple days working at ADknown were very learning intensive and stressful as I had to learn many new topics and frameworks and IDEs including Amazon Web Services, PHP and PHPStorm. Although the learning curve was high, working together with the other co-op students and Tim’s help, I was able to complete the orientation project successfully and was assigned Benjin as my fulltime employee mentor.</p> 
          <p>The first couple months after completing the co-op orientation project I worked on various tasks that Benjin had for me. These included adding additional features to an in-house deploy tool, adding components to existing cron jobs, and adding additional logic to existing systems as needed.</p>
          <p>The rest of my co-op work term was spent working on the websites implemented and maintained by ADknown using an in-house Content Management System (CMS) built by Benjin. I found this work to be very interesting as it allowed me to gain experience working as a full stack developer.</p>
          <p>ADknown’s CMS built by Benjin allows for developers to simply create dynamic content websites for the various sites ADknown manages. Learning how to use the CMS along with being able to implement websites with it allowed for me to quickly pick up the various aspects of site development at ADknown. The rest of my co-op work term was spent building new websites to use the CMS and maintaining the existing websites.</p>
          <p>Towards the end of my co-op at ADknown, I was able to update the CMS to “CMS v3” which used Composer. Composer is a PHP library / package management system allowing for easily updating and maintaining the CMS across all websites without having to worry about the different “versions” of sites. This was a big breakthrough as it made implementing site-wide updates to the CMS relatively simple and drastically cut the maintenance time of each site.</p>
