    <!-- Main Content -->
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>The following goals are those in which I had throughout my eight months at ADknown:</p>
          <h2>1. Learn PHP</h2>
          <p>The main language that I used throughout my co-op work term at ADknown was PHP. This goal allowed me to make learning the language a focus of the work term ensuring that I actually spend time to understand the language. Learning the language allowed me to implement solutions using language specific frameworks along with decreasing the amount of development time required to implement the solution.</p>
          <p>This goal will help me in the future as developing websites with PHP becomes easier. Along with this, learning a language that has server side processing will help me in the future as a full stack developer. Knowing PHP along with website languages like HTML and CSS allows for me to develop websites that can be built dynamically along with more functionality than being static.</p>
          <h2>2. Learn Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h2>
          <p>Throughout my co-op work term at ADknown, AWS played an influential role as many of the systems I worked on including the websites used many features within AWS. These features included but are not limited to: CodeDeploy, EC2 and S3. Learning the basics of AWS was critical to being successful during the work term as it was used on a day to day basis.</p>
          <p>Becoming familiar with web services and cloud computing like Amazon is crucial for computing these days as a majority of services are provided through a third-party source such as Amazon. Therefore, becoming comfortable with AWS and learning some of the core features is very beneficial for my future career.</p>
          <h2>3. Learn to play Pool</h2>
          <p>As a co-op employee at ADknown I had access to a pool table allowing this goal to become necessary. Learning how to play pool allowed me to play pool with my fellow co-ops as well as other employees. At the beginning of the semester, I was unable to hold the pool cue, after spending time playing with the other co-ops and them teaching me how to play I was able to carry my weight during the co-op 2v2s.</p>
          <p>This goal is loosely applicable to my future career unless there is a pool table at future job locations. Although, it does add a soft skill as knowing how to play pool is important for bar settings and overall leisurely entertainment.</p>
          <h2>4. Research and play with various website layouts & design</h2>
          <p>When implementing a new website, sometimes looking through website templates was required in order to find one that would match the content for the website unless it was given. Finding templates that were responsive, reasonable to the content, and visually pleasing allowed for me to strengthen my creative side of web development.</p>
          <p>This goal is important as being able to design a website is equally important as being able to implement one. As being able to implement a website relies on having a website to implement. Having the experience of viewing the various templates along with their designs allowed me to see the various design decisions made and influence my future design decisions I might have to make in the future when designing websites.</p> 
          <h2>5. Take More Notes</h2>
          <p>While working at ADknown, part of my job was to tweak existing sites with multiple different changes. These changes were sometimes documented in a ticket on JIRA or given to me verbally by a co-worker. In order to remember what these changes are, writing them down would help to ensure that they are not forgotten. Taking notes also comes in handy before the weekly developers meeting where you can make a list of everything you’ve done the week before as to not forget anything when listing your tasks.</p>
          <p>Improving on how the frequency and quality of notes taken will benefit my future career and education as it will help me remember things and shorten the amount of time spent recovering forgotten items. Writing things down will also help keep record of the work that I’ve done and help provide proof if anything is questioned.</p>
          <h2>6. Become familiar with Git</h2>
          <p>Learning Git has been a goal of mine for a while but I was never able to truly learn how to properly use Git until working at ADknown. The use of Git on ADknown’s multiple projects as well as working with multiple people provided experience with using Git’s core features. Along with the core features, learning how to handle merge conflicts and revert branches were also two areas I gained experience in.</p> 
          <p>Gaining knowledge and experience with Git is very important as it is one of the main source control programs for programmers. Being able to understand the various features and what they do will help me deal with complications and future positions where Git is used.</p> 
          <h2>7. Learn PHP Storm Features & Shortcuts</h2>
          <p>This goal is very specific to ADknown as the primary IDE used for development there is PHPStorm. As of this, knowing PHPStorm shortcuts to preform basic tasks would improve workplace productivity and speed of development as less time is spent looking up how to do something or moving around code.</p> 
          <p>Gaining knowledge on PHPStorm would be beneficial for my future careers as it would allow me to learn what IDEs are capable of. Along with this, if I am able to choose the IDE I work with at another place I can suggest using PHPStorm as I am familiar with its user interface.</p>
